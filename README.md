# The Common RISC Platform

Welcome to the CRP Github repo. There's not a lot here right now, and what is here
is mostly barely comprehensible screeds written in late night fits of rage and angst.

The resources folder contains work that has already been embarked on, but it is by
no means set in stone, complete, or even sane. Consider the work that has been done
as nothing more than a loose collection of ideas and possible directions that this
project could go in.

The design goals document outlines some overarching objectives I hope to accomplish
with this project, and should be considered the only 'definitive' document currently
published here. Everything else is pretty much up in the air.

Currently, development focus is on more definitively elucidating the high-level
system architecture. Some work has been achieved here, but there is still
much to be done.

Your interest in this project is greatly appreciated!
