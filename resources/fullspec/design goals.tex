\section{Design Goals and Rules}
The development of the Common RISC Platform is informed and directed by these goals and rules, in the
hopes that something useful will come of it at the end of the day.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The user must, at all times, retain \textbf{full control} over their system
	\item The platform must make use of established free and open industry standards wherever possible
	\item The platform must be flexible and extensible to meet the computing needs of the mid-term future
	\item Anyone should be able to develop and produce a CRP-compliant system
	\item Any CRP system must be able to boot a fully vanilla Linux kernel with no proprietary firmware blobs
	either in the kernel or in the platform firmware
	\item All CRP hardware should be as interoperable and cross-compatible as possible
	\item The platform should be suitable as a replacement for the PC in all form factors
	\item The platform design should be as simple as humanly possible
	\item Software targeted at the platform must be able to run on all systems with no errors (i.e. a common ISA)
\end{itemize}
